          description: |-
            Applies a level of generalisation to the isochrone polygons generated as a `smoothing_factor` between `0` and `100.0`.
            Generalisation is produced by determining a maximum length of a connecting line between two points found on the outside of a containing polygon.
            If the distance is larger than a threshold value, the line between the two points is removed and a smaller connecting line between other points is used.
            Note that the minimum length of this connecting line is ~1333m, and so when the `smoothing_factor` results in a distance smaller than this, the minimum value is used.
            The threshold value is determined as `(maximum_radius_of_isochrone / 100) * smoothing_factor`.
            Therefore, a value closer to 100 will result in a more generalised shape.
            The polygon generation algorithm is based on Duckham and al. (2008) `"Efficient generation of simple polygons for characterizing the shape of a set of points in the plane."`
